# LK201-Rebuild


> Note: This  project only 50% complete and 100% untested.

This project is to replace the membrane inside of a LK201 VT220 keyboard.

Doing so it destructive and not reversible however if the alternative is a non-functional keyboard...


## Remaining work to complete
* PCB revision 2
    * Move some key rows down by about 0.5mm
    * Improvement mechanical fitment
    * Mounting holes
    * Insulating layer/drill guide
    * Keycap Inserts


## Fabrication
When getting the PCB fabricated you can split them into parts. This may or may not save cost.
